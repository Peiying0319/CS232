1.What instructions evaluate “a>6”?
    A:cmpl $6,-4(%ebp)

2.What happens if we delete the “jmp” instruction?
    A: .L2 function will be called again for condition a>6.

3.Can you rewrite the condition with “jg” in place of “jle”? Why or why not?
    A:If you rewrite the condition, you will need to do jg .L2
        addl $2,-12(%ebp)
        jmp .L3
.L2:
        addl $-2,-12(%ebp)
.L3:
        leave
        ret
